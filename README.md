# SMS Classifier
Focuses on developing a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). 
# Data Set
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, titled " spam.csv" .
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham, with two columns: 'v1' for labels (ham or spam) and 'v2' for the text of the messages. We preprocess the data, perform Encoding , and visualize key insights to better understand the distribution of spam and ham messages.
